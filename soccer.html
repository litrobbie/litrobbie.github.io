		<h2>Childhood</h2>
		
			<p>I have been playing soccer since I can remember. I have always loved soccer. As a little kid I use to dream about being a professional soccer player. My love for soccer all started in AYSO when I learned how to play with my dad as my coach. After a few games everyone knew who I was because I was so good at a young age. I was known as the kid with the yellow cleats. This is because I had yellow cleats, its pretty self-explanitory.</p>
			
		<h2>Present and Future Goals</h2>
		
			<p> <img id="soccer-image"src="https://github.com/litrobbie/litrobbie.github.io/blob/master/images/soccer.jpg?raw=true" alt="Soccer field with ball"> Today, I play on the CDA Slammers Academy team. I am one of the starters on this team. The team that I am on now has won 74 games in a row with 0 losses. I want to go to UCLA with a soccer scholarship. If I am given the oppurtunity to go to professional soccer I would take it. But otherwise I would like to play soccer as long as I can and I would love to even when I older.</p>
