		<h2>My Skills</h2>
		
			<p>I can type up to 50 WPM on a computer. Another skill I have is that I am on a academy soccer team and have been playing soccer since I was 7 years old. I am really good in school, I always keep my gpa at 3.7 or above.</p>
			
		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		
			<p>My favorite thing to do is play soccer, to me soccer is not just a game it is a lifestyle. Also, I like to watch soccer or youtube. Another hobby is I like to listen to music. Another one of my favoite things to do is to listen to music, but my mom does not like my music so much so I do not listen to music that much.Lastly, I like to hang out with my friends and play video games.

			<h2>My Family</h2>
			
			<p>My mom and dad have been together 16 years and they had their first child about a year after their wedding. My older sister is 15 and just recently had a quincea&ntildeera. She is on her high school JV soccer team. I am the middle child, and I am the most outgoing from my siblings. My brother is the youngest of the 3 of us. He is a really good gamer, and sometimes I admire his video game skills. He can beat me at any game besides FIFA. Overall, my siblings and I get along very well. We are all Mexican and American but only my sister speaks spanish. On my mom's side of the family I have only 5 family member including my grandma, aunt and uncle, and their two kids. But on my dad's side I can't count on my two hands. This is because my grandma and grandpa had 5 kids and they all had at least 3 kids.</p>
