		<h2>High School</h2>
		
			<p>My dream high school would be to go to Robert A. Millikan in Lakewood,CA. But I would also be interested in going to a Catholic School for a soccer scholarship. I have been offered by one high school a scholarship but I can't remember the name of it off the top of my head.</p>
			
		<h2>College</h2>
		
			<p> My ultimate dream is to go to <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">UCLA</a> with a soccer scholarship or a education scholarship. But it is a little out of my parents price range, even though I could just get financial aid it is still hard to get accepted. Another college I would like to go to is Alabama. But I would be honored to go to any college with good soccer team or football team.</p>
			
		<h2>Career Interests</h2>
		
		<p> I would love to be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiologist" targe="_blank">Anesthesiologist</a> or just a doctor in general because I love helping people and I have a cousin that was born with a defect on her esophagus I would like to help discover something to help her because she gets made fun of for not being “normal”. But another profession I would like to do is be a professional soccer player or football player.</p>
		
		<h2>Goals</h2>
		
		<p>My goals are to go to a college get a doctoral degree at UCLA and to be a doctor at Kaiser Permanente or to be a doctor at a hospital. Another goal of mine is to be on my high school soccer team and football team.</p>
